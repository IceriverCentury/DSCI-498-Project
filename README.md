# Project Title: Abusive Language Detection From Joined Modelling

# Project Abstract: Effectively identifying aggressive and abusive words online is a critical task in nowadays social media platforms, where people want to build up and maintain a healthy online community. Though the NLP community has come a long way on abuse detection through various methods and has got promising outcomes, those methods have so far only focused on independent objects, specifically,  the linguistic properties of the comments and the online communities of users, and they disregarded the internal relationship between peopleâ€™s language and their emotional state. This project aims to make a difference by initiating a joint model of emotion and abusive language detection. It plans to experiment in a multi-task learning framework that allows one task to inform the other, testing if incorporating affective features could bring significant improvements in the performance of abusive language detection.
